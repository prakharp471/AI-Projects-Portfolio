# AI-Projects-Portfolio
A collection of real-world AI-powered projects using tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and other no-code/low-code platforms. Built to explore productivity, automation, and business applications of generative AI.


Project 1: AI-Powered Budget Tracker for a Restaurant (No-Code with Claude AI): This project showcases a no-code, AI-driven budget tracker built using Claude AI for a fictional restaurant, The Lakehouse. Using just a screenshot of financial data, I created an interactive dashboard that compares budget vs actuals, calculates profit/loss, and includes advanced visualizations like KPI cards, revenue mix pie charts, and expense control bar graphs. The tracker also features editable fields, real-time forecasting, and scenario analysis to support better decision-making. This hands-on project deepened my understanding of prompt engineering and showed how generative AI can be used to create real business toolsâ€”without writing a single line of code.
